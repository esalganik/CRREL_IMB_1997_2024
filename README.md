This dataset contains data from the network of various CRREL Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoys deployed between 1997 and 2024. The interfaces of 82 ice mass balance (IMB) buoys were identified using a combination of temperature data and data from acoustic sounders. Buoys deployed between 1993 and 2015 were reprocessed after West (2020). The dataset processing was supported by the Research Council of Norway project INTERAAC (grant no. 328957).
